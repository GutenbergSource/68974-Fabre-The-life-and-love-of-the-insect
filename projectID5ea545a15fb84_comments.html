<HTML><BODY>Jean-Henri Fabre (1823â€“1915) was a well-known French naturalist, entomologist, and author known for the lively style of his popular books on the lives of insects. This is one of the many titles he produced, and deals with the lives of sacred beetle, and similar insects.

<p>Although we already have a few of his books in Project Gutenberg, a large number are still not available. I will be preparing all remaining English translations in the Public Domain in the coming weeks.

</p><p>The original scans are <a href="https://archive.org/details/lifeloveofinsect00fabriala/mode/2up">here</a>.
